# Nth Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers. Write a function `fib()` that takes in an interger n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

## **Example:**

```javascript
Sample input: 6
Sample output: 5 // (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
```
