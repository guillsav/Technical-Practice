# Matching Brackets

Write a function `matchingBrackets()` that takes in a string made up of brackets `()`, `[]`, `{}`. The function should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string `matches` or `(the string is balanced)`. A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a given type as it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched. Note that a closing bracket cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Similarly, brackets cannot overlap each other as in `[(])`.

## **Example:**

```javascript
Sample input: "([])(){}(())()()"
Sample output: true
```
